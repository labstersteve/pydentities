### Some Python identities to help understand the interpreter.

This is the Jupyter Notebook for a lightning talk to the PyData London group on 5 July 2016.

It explains by example various equivalences in the language that will hopefully give the reader some
insight into the operation of the interpreter. The HTML version retains outputs to make it easier to read.
The notebook itslef has no outputs, to amke executing it perhaps a little more fun.

I'd be very happy to expand this or accept pull requests that enlarge on the current material.
