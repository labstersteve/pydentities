### Some Python identities to help understand the interpreter.

This Jupyter Notebook began as a lightning talk to the
PyData London group on 5 July, 2016.

It explains by example various equivalences in the language
that will hopefully give the reader some insight into the
operation of the interpreter.
The HTML version retains outputs to make it easier to read.
The notebook itself has no outputs, and can be presented as
an interactive slide show with executable code cells.

I'll be very happy to accept pull requests that expand or
enlarge on the current material.
