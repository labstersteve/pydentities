Some Python identities to help understand the interpreter

This is the Jupyter Notebook for a lightning talk to the PyData London group on 5 July 2016.

It explains by example various equivalences in the language that will hopefully give the reader some
insight into the operation of the interpreter.

I'd be very happy to expand this or accept pull requests that enlarge on the current material.
